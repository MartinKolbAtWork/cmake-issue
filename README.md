This project shows the generation differences between CMake's "Unix Makefile" and "Ninja" generator.

It is expected that both produce the same binary. However, the two binariesâ€™ "NEEDED" entries, which reference shared libraries, differ. As a result, the "Ninja" based version is not executable.

Start the "build.sh" script to run the demo.

A workaround for this bug is to add a "IMPORTED_NO_SONAME ON" in the "set_target_properties" statement of the used shared library.
